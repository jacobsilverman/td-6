Team Treehouse Techdegree Project 6: Exceeds Expectations

I went for the exceeds grade.
You can run the project with npm start

thank you!

nb. If you have trouble reading the single scraper.js file, you can checkout the previous commit https://github.com/jacobsilverman/techdegree-project-6/commit/0b2bc08e77db62fe98e715c910c5ad13fe514da7 in which I had 3 seperate files (utilizing module.exports and require). However, the peer review feedback I was given in slack was to bundle the files into 1 scraper.js file since that was in the spec. I personally prefer the seperation of concerns of 3 files and found it easier to read but in the final commit I have listened to the feedback so there is only one scraper.js file in the latest commit to master.
